# Rutgers-University-Newark-Facebook-pagelike-network

This is a research paper done in an Applied mathematics 2 course with the use of Gephi software which is a graph visualization tool. In this Porject, I have conducted an analysis of Rutgers University Newark Facebook page-like network. For that, I was able to downlord a datasheet in zip format using facebook scrapper called Netvizz API.
